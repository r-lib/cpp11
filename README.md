cpp11 helps you to interact with R objects using C++ code.
Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp) package.

## Using cpp11 in a package

To add cpp11 to an existing package, put your C++ files in the `src/` directory and add the following to your DESCRIPTION file:

```
LinkingTo: cpp11
```

Then decorate C++ functions you want to expose to R with `[[cpp11::register]]`. 
*Note that this is a [C++11 attribute](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes), not a comment like is used in Rcpp.*

cpp11 is a header only library with no hard dependencies and does not use a shared library, so it is straightforward and reliable to use in packages without fear of compile-time and run-time mismatches.

Alternatively, you can [vendor](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#vendoring) the current installed version of cpp11 headers into your package with `cpp11::vendor_cpp11()`.
This ensures the headers will remain unchanged until you explicitly update them.

## Getting started

See [vignette("cpp11")](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/cpp11.html) to get started using cpp11 in your scripts, particularly if you are new to C++ programming.

## Getting help [![RStudio community](https://img.shields.io/badge/community-cpp11-blue?style=social&logo=rstudio&logoColor=75AADB)](https://community.rstudio.com/new-topic?category=Package%20development&tags=cpp11)

[RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/new-topic?category=Package%20development&tags=cpp11) with the `cpp11` tag is the best place to ask for help using cpp11 or interfacing C++ with R.

## Motivations

[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp) has been a widely successful project, however over the years a number of issues and additional C++ features have arisen.
Adding these features to Rcpp would require a great deal of work, or in some cases would be impossible without severely breaking backwards compatibility.

**cpp11** is a ground up rewrite of C++ bindings to R with different design trade-offs and features.

Changes that motivated cpp11 include:

- Enforcing [copy-on-write semantics](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#copy-on-write-semantics).
- Improving the [safety](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#improve-safety) of using the R API from C++ code.
- Supporting [ALTREP objects](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#altrep-support).
- Using [UTF-8 strings](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#utf-8-everywhere) everywhere.
- Applying newer [C++11 features](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#c11-features).
- Having a more straightforward, [simpler implementation](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#simpler-implementation).
- Faster [compilation time](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#compilation-speed) with lower memory requirements.
- Being *completely* [header only](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#header-only) to avoid ABI issues.
- Capable of [vendoring](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#vendoring) if desired.
- More robust [protection](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#protection) using a much more efficient linked list data structure.
- [Growing vectors](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#growing-vectors) more efficiently.

See [vignette("motivations")](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html) for full details on the motivations for writing cpp11.

## Conversion from Rcpp

See [vignette("converting")](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/converting.html) if you are already familiar with Rcpp or have an existing package that uses Rcpp and want to convert it to use cpp11.
