In many cases there is no need to convert a package from Rcpp.
If the code is already written and you don't have a very compelling need to use cpp11 I would recommend you continue to use Rcpp.
However if you _do_ feel like your project will benefit from using cpp11 this vignette will provide some guidance and doing the conversion.

It is also a place to highlight some of the largest differences between Rcpp and cpp11.

## Read-only vs writable vectors

The largest difference between cpp11 and Rcpp classes is that Rcpp classes modify their data in place, whereas cpp11 classes require copying the data to a writable class for modification.

The default classes, e.g. `cpp11::doubles` are *read-only* classes that do not permit modification.
If you want to modify the data you need to use the classes in the `cpp11::writable` namespace, e.g. `cpp11::writable::doubles`.

In addition use the `writable` variants if you need to create a new R vector entirely in C++.

## Appending behavior

One major difference in Rcpp and cpp11 is how vectors are grown.
Rcpp vectors have a `push_back()` method, but unlike `std::vector()` no additional space is reserved when pushing.
This makes calling `push_back()` repeatably very expensive, as the entire vector has to be copied each call.

In contrast `cpp11` vectors grow efficiently, reserving extra space.
Because of this you can do ~10,000,000 vector appends with cpp11 in approximately the same amount of time that Rcpp does 10,000, as this benchmark demonstrates.

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = cpp11test:::should_run_benchmarks()}
grid <- expand.grid(len = 10 ^ (0:7), pkg = "cpp11", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
grid <- rbind(
  grid,
  expand.grid(len = 10 ^ (0:4), pkg = "rcpp", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
)
b_grow <- bench::press(.grid = grid,
  {
    fun = match.fun(sprintf("%sgrow_", ifelse(pkg == "cpp11", "", paste0(pkg, "_"))))
    bench::mark(
      fun(len)
    )
  }
)[c("len", "pkg", "min", "mem_alloc", "n_itr", "n_gc")]
saveRDS(b_grow, "growth.Rds", version = 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, dev = "svg", fig.ext = "svg"}
b_grow <- readRDS("growth.Rds")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(b_grow, aes(x = len, y = min, color = pkg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  bench::scale_y_bench_time() +
  scale_x_log10(
    breaks = scales::trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 10^x),
    labels = scales::trans_format("log10", scales::math_format(10^.x))
  ) +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "log-log plot of vector size vs construction time", x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(b_grow)
```

## Mechanics of converting a package from Rcpp

1. Add cpp11 to `LinkingTo`
1. Convert all instances of `// [[Rcpp::export]]` to `[[cpp11::export]]`
1. Clean and recompile the package, e.g. `pkgbuild::clean_dll()` `pkgload::load_all()`
1. Run tests `devtools::test()`
1. Start converting function by function
   - Remember you can usually inter-convert between cpp11 and Rcpp classes by going through `SEXP` if needed.
   - Converting the code a bit at a time (and regularly running your tests) is the best way to do the conversion correctly and make progress

## Include order

Due to cpp11 redefining the Rboolean enum any cpp11 header needs to come _before_ any Rcpp or Rinternals.h include. Errors like

> error: redefinition of enumerator 'FALSE'

Indicate this is a problem and can be resolved by ensuring the cpp11 headers are included first.

## STL includes

Rcpp.h includes a number of STL headers automatically, notably `<string>` and `<vector>`, however the cpp11 headers generally do not. If you have errors like

> error: no type named 'string' in namespace 'std'

You will need to include the appropriate STL header, in this case `<string>`.

## Calling R from C++

```c++
Rcpp::Function as_tibble("as_tibble", Rcpp::Environment::namespace_env("tibble"));
as_tibble(x, Rcpp::Named(".rows", num_rows), Rcpp::Named(".name_repair", name_repair));
```

```c++
using namespace cpp11::literals; // so we can use ""_nm syntax

cpp11::function as_tibble = cpp11::package("tibble")["as_tibble"];
return as_tibble(x, ".rows"_nm = num_rows, ".name_repair"_nm = name_repair);
```
