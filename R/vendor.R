#' Vendor the cpp11 dependency
#'
#' Vendoring is the act of making your own copy of the 3rd party packages your
#' project is using. It is often used in the go language community.
#'
#' This function vendors cpp11 into your package by copying the cpp11
#' headers into the `inst/include` folder of your package and adding
#' 'cpp11 version: XYZ' to the top of the files, where XYZ is the version of
#' cpp11 currently installed on your machine.
#'
#' If you choose to vendor the headers you should _remove_ `LinkingTo:
#' cpp11` from your DESCRIPTION.
#'
#' **Note**: vendoring places the responsibility of updating the code on
#' **you**. Bugfixes and new features in cpp11 will not be available for your
#' code until you run `cpp_vendor()` again.
#'
#' @inheritParams cpp_register
#' @param headers The path to the cpp11 headers to vendor. By default this is
#'  the path where R installed the cpp11 package. You can change this to
#'  use a different version of cpp11, such as as the development version
#'  from GitHub. 
#' @return The file path to the vendored code (invisibly).
